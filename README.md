# ðŸ‘‹ Spring Boot and MySQL Connection Example

A simple example project demonstrating how to connect a Spring Boot application to a MySQL database using JPA (Java Persistence API). This repository includes a `Student` entity to represent a student table in the MySQL database and provides a starting point for developers looking to integrate Spring Boot with MySQL in their applications. 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK) - version 8 or higher
2. MySQL Server - Make sure it's up and running with the necessary permissions set up.
3. MySQL Workbench (or any MySQL client) - to interact with the MySQL database and manage its tables and data.
